> This is an example of how to generate scaffolds with gulp (it's not a plugin!)

This project shows how to use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to generate projects from a [scaffold](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/scaffold). The templates are a bit boring, but the two things that really matter are:

* the [scaffold examples](./scaffolds.js), and
* the [gulpfile.js](./gulpfile.js)

## Install

Enter the following in the command line to git clone the project and install `devDependencies`:

```sh
$ https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gulp-scaffold-example.git && npm i
```

**Generate the scaffolds**

Assuming you have `gulp` installed globally, you should now be able to build the scaffolds with the `gulp` command.
